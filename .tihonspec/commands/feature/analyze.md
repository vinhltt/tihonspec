## ⛔ CRITICAL: Error Handling

**If ANY script returns an error, you MUST:**
1. **STOP immediately** - Do NOT attempt workarounds or auto-fixes
2. **Report the error** - Show the exact error message to the user
3. **Wait for user** - Ask user how to proceed before taking any action

**DO NOT:**
- Try alternative approaches when scripts fail
- Create branches manually when script validation fails
- Guess or assume what the user wants after an error
- Continue with partial results

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/feature.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.tihonspec/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/feature.analyze`.

## Execution Steps
### Step 0: Validate or Infer Task ID

**CRITICAL**: Handle task_id before any operations.

1. **Parse user input**:
   - Extract first argument from `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Expected format: `[folder/]prefix-number`

2. **Check if task_id provided**:

   **If task_id provided and valid** (matches pattern `[folder/]prefix-number`):
   - Convert to lowercase (case-insensitive)
   - → Proceed to Step 1 with this task_id

   **If task_id missing or invalid**:
   - → Proceed to inference (step 3)

3. **Infer from conversation context**:
   - Search this conversation for:
     - Previous `/feature.*` or `/ut.*` command executions with task_id
     - Task_id patterns mentioned (e.g., "pref-001", "MRR-123", "aa-2")
     - Output mentioning "Feature pref-001" or similar

   **If context found** (e.g., "pref-001"):
   - Use **AskUserQuestion** tool to confirm:
     ```json
     {
       "questions": [{
         "question": "No task_id provided. Use detected context 'pref-001'?",
         "header": "Task ID",
         "options": [
           {"label": "Yes, use pref-001", "description": "Proceed with the detected task"},
           {"label": "No, specify another", "description": "I'll provide a different task_id"}
         ],
         "multiSelect": false
       }]
     }
     ```
   - If user selects "Yes" → task_id = inferred value (lowercase), proceed to Step 1
   - If user selects "No" → Show usage, STOP

   **If NO context found**:
   ```
   ❌ Error: task_id is required

   Usage: /feature.analyze <task-id>
   Example: /feature.analyze pref-001

   No previous task context found in this conversation.
   ```
   STOP - Do NOT proceed to Step 1

4. **Validate task_id format**:
   - Must match pattern: `[folder/]prefix-number`
   - Prefix must be in `.feature.env` TIHONSPEC_PREFIX_LIST
   - Examples:
     - ✅ `/feature.analyze pref-001` → task_id: `pref-001`
     - ✅ `/feature.analyze PREF-001` → task_id: `pref-001` (case-insensitive)
     - ❌ `/feature.analyze` without context → ERROR (no task ID)

5. **Determine feature directory**:
   - Pattern: `.tihonspec/{folder}/{prefix-number}/`
   - Default folder: `feature` (from TIHONSPEC_DEFAULT_FOLDER)
   - If not found → ERROR, suggest running `/feature.tihonspec` first

**After Validation**:
- Proceed to Step 1 only if task_id valid
- Use task_id to locate feature files


### 1. Initialize Analysis Context

Run `.tihonspec/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh {task_id} --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root (pass the validated task_id from Step 0). Parse JSON for TASK_ID, FEATURE_DIR, AVAILABLE_DOCS.

Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md

Abort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Overview/Context
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Stories
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices
- Data Model references
- Phases
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs
- Descriptions
- Phase grouping
- Parallel markers [P]
- Referenced file paths

**From constitution:**

- Load `.tihonspec/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation

### 3. Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):

- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`)
- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria
- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)
- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements

### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)

Focus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.

#### A. Duplication Detection

- Identify near-duplicate requirements
- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation

#### B. Ambiguity Detection

- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria
- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)

#### C. Underspecification

- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome
- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment
- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan

#### D. Constitution Alignment

- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle
- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution

#### E. Coverage Gaps

- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story
- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)

#### F. Inconsistency

- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)
- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)
- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)
- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)

### 5. Severity Assignment

Use this heuristic to prioritize findings:

- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case
- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order

### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report

Output a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |

(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)

**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)

**Metrics:**

- Total Requirements
- Total Tasks
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)
- Ambiguity Count
- Duplication Count
- Critical Issues Count

### 7. Provide Next Actions

At end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:

- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/feature.implement`
- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions
- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., "Run /feature.tihonspec with refinement", "Run /feature.plan to adjust architecture", "Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'"

### 8. Offer Remediation

Ask the user: "Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)

## Operating Principles

### Context Efficiency

- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Guidelines

- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)
- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)
